// As your app grows, you can catch a lot of bugs with typechecking. For some applications, you can use JavaScript extensions like Flow or TypeScript to typecheck your whole application. But even if you donâ€™t use those, React has some built-in typechecking abilities. To run typechecking on the props for a component, you can assign the special propTypes property:


class Greeting extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <h1>Hello, {true}</h1>
    );
  }
}

export default Greeting


Greeting.propTypes = {

  name: PropTypes.number.isRequired
};
